# Android Academy 

Android educational app template, use it and you will only need to focus on the contents of your courses in order to quickly launch your app idea. The repository is a boilerplate of an Android Studio project that is composed by layout files, activities control and database integration everything already set up for you so that you can get a headstart to get your idea to life. The template can be used freely as a whole or in part, if you do use it, we would be delighted to know it and add the link to your app in the list below. Moreover, if you extend the functionalities and you think that other educational projects would benefit, please do share it here and we will add it to the project.

## Overview 

The app is divided into four main categories: Explore, Chat, Tools and Profile. 

### Explore 

The explore section is the one where your courses and lessons will be displayed. Each course is formed by a series of lessons. Each lesson is composed of a number of sections and a final quiz with 10 multiple choices questions at the end. 

### Chat 

The chat section will host an ad-hoc forum where users will be able to ask for help and discuss topics related to your courses. _This section is not developed yet, if you are interested check future updates._ 

### Tools 

In the tools section, you will be able to offer the user useful tools related to the contents of your courses. If you prefer this section can be easily removed, however, we strongly suggest not to because it is a good incentive for users that have completed all the currently available courses to keep the app.
_For examples and ideas on what kind of tools you could offer, see the apps in the [apps section](#apps)._

### Profile

In the profile section, the user is able to see his progress in each course and his overall level. The progress of each course is calculated based on the results of the tests of the lessons in the course. Instead, you should decide the overall level division and calculation; the default one is composed by 4 levels (beginner, amateur, expert, professional) and supposes the presence of about 20 lessons.
