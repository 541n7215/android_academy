## Overview 

The app is divided into four main categories: Explore, Chat, Tools and Profile. 

### Explore 

The explore section is the one where your courses and lessons will be displayed. Each course is formed by a series of lessons. Each lesson is composed of a number of sections and a final quiz with 10 multiple choices questions at the end. 

### Chat 

The chat section will host an ad-hoc forum where users will be able to ask for help and discuss topics related to your courses. _This section is not developed yet, if you are interested check future updates._ 

### Tools 

In the tools section, you will be able to offer the user useful tools related to the contents of your courses. If you prefer this section can be easily removed, however, we strongly suggest not to because it is a good incentive for users that have completed all the currently available courses to keep the app.
_For examples and ideas on what kind of tools you could offer, see the apps in the [ apps section ](#apps)._

### Profile

In the profile section, the user is able to see his progress in each course and his overall level. The progress of each course is calculated based on the results of the tests of the lessons in the course. Instead, you should decide the overall level division and calculation; the default one is composed by 4 levels (beginner, amateur, expert, professional) and supposes the presence of about 20 lessons.
